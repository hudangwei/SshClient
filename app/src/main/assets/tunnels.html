<H3>TUNNELS Screen</H3>
<P>SSH tunnels can forward TCP connections on either the local or remote host over to the other host.</P>
<P>This screen has one button per tunnel defined in the database.  If the button has black text, the tunnel is
    closed and a short click will open or edit it.  If the button has red text, the tunnel is open and a short
    click will close it.  In either state, a long click will delete it from the database, closing it first if
    it is open.</P>
<P>You must already be connected to a remote host for the TUNNELS screen to display.  If you attempt to display
    it before connecting, the opening will be pending until you connect, and then the TUNNELS screen will open.
    You can also switch to a different screen within the app or press the HOME button at any time and your open
    tunnels will remain open (until Android decides it needs the memory for something else, that is).</P>
<P><B>Local =&gt; Remote</B> - connections to a port on the local Android device are forwarded to the port on
    the remote host, encrypted over the SSH connection.  If you put 0 for the listening port number, an unused
    port is picked for you each time the tunnel is opened.  Anyway, any connection made on the Android device
    to the tunnel's listen port are forwarded over the SSH link to the session's remote host, then it is
    connected to the tunnel's connection hostname:portnumber.</P>
<P><B>Local &lt;= Remote</B> - connections to a port on the remote host are forwarded to the port on the local
    Android device, encrypted over the SSH connection.  You must specify a specific listening port (1..65535).
    Any connection made to the tunnel's listen port on the remote host are forwarded over the SSH link back to
    the Android device then it is connected to the tunnel's connection hostname:portnumber.</P>
