<H3>FILE TRANSFER Screen</H3>
<P>This screen is used to transfer files between the local device and the current session's remote host.  It
    has these four sections from top to bottom:
<UL>
    <LI><B>function buttons</B> - switch between local and remote, initiates functions on selected file</LI>
    <LI><B>selected files</B> - list of files that have been selected</LI>
    <LI><B>navigation buttons</B> - select which directory on either local or remote to look at</LI>
    <LI><B>directory listing</B> - list of the files in the directory selected by the navigation
        buttons</LI>
</UL>
Notes:
<UL>
    <LI>Each of the four sections independently scrolls horizontally.</LI>
    <LI>You can access a local-files-only version that does not require connection to a remote host by
        clicking on the Android's menu button, then clicking <TT>More</TT> then <TT>local files
            only</TT>.</LI>
</UL>
</P>

<P>Various function buttons may appear on the top row depending on the state of the app.
    Here are the possibilities, in the order they appear:
<UL>
    <LI><B>remote &lt;</B> - navigate directories on the remote host</LI>
    <LI><B>search</B> - search directories for a wildcard pattern</LI>
    <LI><B>make dir</B> - create a sub-directory (must currently be in a writable directory)</LI>
    <LI><B>clear</B> - clear list of selected files (must have something selected)</LI>
    <LI><B>copy</B> - copy selected files to the current directory (all selected files must be readable,
        the current directory must be writable)</LI>
    <LI><B>move</B> - move selected files to the current directory (all selected files must be readable and
        in writable directories, and the current directory must be writable)</LI>
    <LI><B>delete</B> - delete the selected files (files must be in the current directory and the current
        directory must be writable, ie, you can delete files only from the current directory)</LI>
    <LI><B>open</B> - open the one-and-only selected readable file</LI>
    <LI><B>opendir</B> - open the last selected file as a directory (assuming it is a readable directory)
        OR open the last selected zip file as a read-only directory (assuming it is a readable zip
        file)</LI>
    <LI><B>&gt; local</B> - navigate directories on the local device</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
    <LI>The <TT>local files only</TT> version, accessed via the Android's menu, provides <B>local-1</B> and
        <B>local-2</B> buttons which give two independent views of local files (instead of <B>remote</B>
        and <B>local</B> buttons which give a view of remote files and a view of local files).</LI>
</UL>
</P>

<P>The next row contains navigation buttons that can be used to 'pop up' levels in the directory hierarchy.
    If a button has black text, indicating a read-only directory, you can only view the directory, you cannot
    make changes.  If a button is red, indicating a read/write directory, you can both view the directory and
    make changes (add, delete, rename files).  Also, eg, on Android, it is possible for you to not have
    permission to view at an intermediate directory.  If this is the case, those intermediate directories will
    have their names combined with a viewable directory, eg, <TT>data/data/com.outerworldapps.sshclient/</TT>
    all on one button means you can't view either <TT>data</TT> directory, but you can view the
    <TT>com.outerworldapps.sshclient</TT> directory.</P>
<P>Clicking on the last button in the row (which indicates the directory currently being displayed), refreshes
    the listing by re-reading it.  <I>Changes made in one view of a filesystem will not appear in other views
        of the same filesystem, so use this functionality to display any recent updates.</I></P>
<P>To descend into a readable directory, click on it in the list (which causes it to highlight) then click the
    <TT>opendir</TT> button.  The <TT>opendir</TT> button can also navigate into a readable zip file as if it
    were a read-only directory.  Some patience may be required if the directory or zip file is large.</P>

<P>To copy file(s) (and/or directory tree(s)):
<OL>
    <LI>Select a file or directory tree to be copied by clicking on its name in the listing.  Its name
        highlights in the directory listing and the name will also be added to the list of selected files
        at the top of the screen.  If you have permission to read it, the <TT>copy</TT> button will
        appear.</LI>
    <LI>To select a range of files, select the first file of the range by clicking on the name, then select
        the last file of the range by double-clicking on the name.</LI>
    <LI>To deselect a file, click the highlighted name.  To deselect all files, click the <TT>clear</TT>
        button at the top.</LI>
    <LI>Repeat that step for all files and/or directory trees you want to copy.  You can navigate around
        directories to locate all you want.</LI>
    <LI>Navigate to the directory where you want to copy the file(s).  You may copy them to the same
        directory you are already in if you like.  Usually though you want to navigate to a directory on
        the other system (local vs remote).</LI>
    <LI>Click the <TT>copy</TT> button.  It will prompt you to confirm the copy, allowing you to change the
        name if you like, then perform the copy.  You can cancel a long copy by clicking the
        <TT>Cancel</TT> button when the progress box is showing.</LI>
</OL>
</P>
<P>Notes:
<UL>
    <LI>There is no restriction on local vs remote for the copy operation.  <I>However,</I> if you do a
        remote-to-remote copy, the data will transfer from the remote host to the phone then back to the
        remote host which is very inefficient.  You are much better off using the shell to perform such a
        copy for files of any significant size.</LI>
    <LI>When a file is copied to the Android device, Android considers the file as being owned by the
        SshClient app.  To make it accessible to other apps, you should put it somewhere on the SD card
        storage, which is where the app puts you by default.  Similarly, you can only copy files from the
        Android device that the SshClient app has access to, which is typically just its own files, the
        files on the SD card storage, plus some read-only system files.</LI>
    <LI>While a copy is going (such as for a large file), the app will block you from accessing the same
        session's shell and tunnels screens, because the TCP connection is being heavily used for the copy
        and may not allow access to the other streams.  You can pause the copy and access the other streams
        or start another session to the same host to access shell and tunnel while the copy is
        running.</LI>
    <LI>Similarly, while a copy is going, you will be blocked from using the BACK button, in which case you
        can pause or cancel the copy, then use the BACK button.</LI>
    <LI>Pressing the HOME button while a copy is running lets the copy continue in the background, even if
        Android decides it needs the memory and kills the app, as the service will keep it going.</LI>
</UL>
</P>

<P>To move file(s) (or directory tree(s)), perform the same steps as for copying, except use the <TT>move</TT>
    button instead of <TT>copy</TT>.  Note that moving a file to the same directory with a different name is a
    rename operation.  Moving a file between the local and remote system involves a copy operation followed by
    a delete.</P>

<P>The <TT>open</TT> button will attempt to open the highlighted file if it is readable.  If it is a file on
    the local filesystem, a search is made for an application that can read the file and it is launched.  If
    the file is on the remote host, the file is first copied to a local temporary file directory (called cache
    on Android), then an application is launched.  You may want to either delete or move the file from the
    cache directory when done with it.  Note that the file must also be readable to the application being used
    to display it, which will be the case for files on the SD card.</P>
