<H3>VNC CLIENT Screen</H3>
<P>This screen is used to connect to a VNC server located on a host accessible via SSH.  The VNC
    connection will be transported via a temporary SSH tunnel.</P>
<P>Notes:
    <UL>
        <LI>You do not need to create a tunnel via the <A HREF="tunnels.html">TUNNELS</A> screen.
            The VNC screen creates a temporary tunnel itself.</LI>
        <LI>Since the connection to the VNC server is via an SSH tunnel, the VNC server port can be
            firewalled on the server to allow connections only from the local host.</LI>
    </UL>
</P>
<P>To connect:
    <UL>
        <LI>Switch to the VNC CLIENT screen via the Android menu button -> More -> VNC client.</LI>
        <LI>If not already connected, connect to the VNC server system via SSH by putting in the SSH
            username and hostname in the <TT>user@host[:port]</TT> box at the top of the screen.
            You may need to tap in the <TT>user@host[:port]</TT> box for it to accept entry.</LI>
        <LI>Enter the VNC server port number, usually 5900 + screen number, eg, 5907 for screen 7.</LI>
        <LI>Enter the VNC password for that screen if required.</LI>
    </UL>
</P>
<P>To disconnect, click Android menu button -> Discon.  To reconnect, click Android menu button ->
    Connect.</P>
<P>While connected, the screen may be resized or dragged using two fingers.  For sending mouse events,
    use one finger (short tap for left click, long press for right click).</P>
<P>Tapping the screen will also bring the Android keyboard up if it is not present.</P>

<P>The Android's menu contains these main buttons:
<UL>
    <LI><B>Ctrl-...</B> - the next character entered on the keyboard will be shifted to control character,
        if it is an alphabetic.  If a non-alphabetic is entered, the <TT>Ctrl-...</TT> will be abandoned
        and the character will be sent normally.</LI>
    <LI><B>Ctrl-C</B> - sends a Control-C character to the host.</LI>
    <LI><B>Connect</B> - connect the VNC channel.</LI>
    <LI><B>Discon</B> - disconnect the VNC channel.</LI>
    <LI><B>Paste</B> - sends the contents of a clipboard to the remote host shell.</LI>
    <LI><B>Tab</B> - sends a TAB character to the remote host.</LI>
    <LI><B>More &gt;&gt;</B> - opens up the <A HREF="menubuttons.html#extended">extended menu</A>.</LI>
