<H3>Master Password</H3>
<P>The app stores sensitive information on the device's internal flash memory, namely, the key pair files, the
    known hosts file and saved logins file which might contain saved passwords.  If the device were stolen,
    anyone could then access hosts authorized by those files, which is undesirable.</P>
<P>To combat this, you should create a master password that must be entered whenever the app is started.  It is
    used to encrypt the files stored on the flash memory so they would be useless to anyone who does not know
    the master password.  You can set and/or change the master password at any time.  Changing it causes the
    files to be re-encrypted with the new master password.</P>
<P>A master password is especially recommended if you have any saved passwords or a keypair without a
    passphrase.  It would be a good idea to at least have a simple PIN-style password (as opposed to none at
    all) if you do not want a hard-to-enter one.  The app places no restriction on what is acceptable, except
    that it not be blank.</P>
