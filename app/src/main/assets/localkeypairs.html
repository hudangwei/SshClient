<H3>Local Keypairs</H3>
<P>A Local Keypair is used to identify this app on this device to a remote host.  The identity can be used
    instead of a password so you don't have to store the password on your device and you don't have to type it
    in each time.  Also, some servers may be configured to require keypair authentication and will not accept
    any password at all.</P>
<P>Once a keypair is generated (using random numbers), the public key must be appended to the server's
    <TT>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</TT> file.  If the server is configured to accept a password, you can log in
    using the password (do not save it) then copy/paste the public key into the server's
    <TT>authorized_keys</TT> file.  If the server does not allow password logins, you will have to have some
    other mechanism to accomplish it, such as copy/paste the pubic key into an email that you send to the
    server's administrator.  If the <TT>authorized_keys</TT> file was properly updated, you will be
    authenticated using the keypair and will not need to enter a password next time you log in.</P>
<P>When generating a keypair, it asks for the following information:
<UL>
    <LI><B>Name to identify</B> - written as a tag on the public key so that at some time in the distant
        future, when you look at a remote host's <TT>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</TT> file, you will know where
        this particular public key came from, as it will be tagged with this identifier.  You can only use
        a-z, A-Z, 0-9, @, periods, underscores and hyphens in the name, and a maximum length of 50
        characters.  It is also used to differentiate multiple keypairs on the same device if you create
        more than one, as each one must have an unique name.  The identifier appears at the end of the
        single line of the public key.</LI>
    <LI><B>Passphrase</B> - used as a password for the keypair file itself.  This will safeguard the
        keypair file in case someone steals your device, they won't be able to access your authorized
        remote hosts.  The same passphrase goes with this keypair file, and since the same keypair file is
        used for many remote hosts, you only have to remember this one passphrase.  Leave both boxes blank
        if you do not want a passphrase, in which case you should enable a <A HREF="masterpassword.html">master
            password</A>.</LI>
    <LI><B>DSA/RSA</B> - keypair encryption format.  There are many discussions on the Internet about which
        is more secure.</LI>
    <LI><B>1024/2048/4096</B> - key size.  1024 is the most universally accepted by servers.  The bigger
        the number, the more secure.</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>You can also load a previously generated keypair that you have saved somewhere.  It takes several steps to
    make this work:
<OL>
    <LI>Copy the keypair into the device's clipboard using whatever method you have, possibly from some
        other app.  The text must be formatted to have the public key on the first line and the rest of the
        text containing the private key, which is several lines long.  Typically the public key line begins
        with something like <TT>ssh-rsa</TT> and ends with the identifier it was created with.  The private
        key is several lines long and begins with a line like <TT>-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----</TT> and
        ends with a line like <TT>-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----</TT>.</LI>
    <LI>Click the Android's menu button then click on <TT>local keypairs</TT> then select <TT>load keypair
        directly</TT>.</LI>
    <LI>Click either the <TT>Load from internal clipboard</TT> or <TT>Load from external clipboard</TT>
        button.  You should see a few characters from the beginning of the public key and a few characters
        from the end of the private key string.</LI>
    <LI>Click the <TT>OK</TT> button.  You should get an acknowledgement message saying the keys were
        accepted.</LI>
</OL>
You can load the keypair from either the internal clipboard or the external clipboard.  For better
security, use the internal clipboard wherever possible as it cannot be peeked at by other applications.
</P>
<P>Once created on a particular client, a keypair should not be deleted, as they represent an unique key that
    is used to unlock the hosts that you have added the public key to their <TT>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</TT>
    file.</P>
<P><I><B>Caution:</B></I>  While it is perfectly acceptable to copy <I>public</I> keys using any method
    available, it is considered bad practice to copy <I>private</I> keys around, especially via the external
    clipboard.  The functionality is provided for completeness.  You might, at some level of risk, want to
    back up your private key (along with your public key) by pasting them to a secure host, using the
    <I>internal</I> clipboard, or use file transfer mode.  <I><B>Use at your own risk!</B></I></P>
