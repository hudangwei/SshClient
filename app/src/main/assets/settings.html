<H3>SETTINGS Screen</H3>
<P>This screen holds customization settings.  Use the keyboard or click on the various settings to
    change them.  The changes will not take effect until you click the <TT>SAVE</TT> button.  If you
    click <TT>REVERT</TT>, any changes you have made will be discarded and you can make new changes
    if you like.  If you click the Android's menu to change screens (such as <TT>shell</TT>), your
    changes will be discarded.
<P><B>Cursor style</B> - select whether the cursor for the <A HREF="shell.html">SHELL</A> screen is
    a thin line, a hollow box, a solid block, or none at all.</P>
<P><B>Font size</B> - selects the font size used for the SHELL screen and the directory listing part
    of the <A HREF="filetransfer.html">FILE TRANSFER</A> screen.</P>
<P><B>Include hidden files</B> - includes hidden files (files whose name begin with '.') in the
    directory listing part of the <A HREF="filetransfer.html">FILE TRANSFER</A> screen.</P>
<P><B>Max total chars</B> - selects the number of characters that are saved in memory for each SHELL
    session.  Only powers-of-two are permitted here.  The larger the number, the farther you will be
    able to scroll back to see previous host output.
<P><B>Screen orientation</B> - the orientation for <A HREF="shell.html">SHELL</A> and
    <A HREF="filetransfer.html">FILE TRANSFER</A> screens can be set to:
<UL>
    <LI><B>Unlocked</B> - to allow it to change as the device is rotated</LI>
    <LI><B>Portrait</B> - to lock it in Portrait mode regardless of device rotation</LI>
    <LI><B>Landscape</B> - to lock it in Landscape mode regardless of device rotation</LI>
</UL>
<P><B>Show EOL markers</B> - enables display of a character <SUP>N</SUP><SUB>L</SUB> on the
    <A HREF="shell.html">SHELL</A> screen that indicates the end-of-line as given by the host.</P>
<P><B>Term type</B> - determines the terminal type sent to the host when starting a shell session.
<P><B>Text colors</B> - select the colors used for the <A HREF="shell.html">SHELL</A> screen and the
    directory listing part of the <A HREF="filetransfer.html">FILE TRANSFER</A> screen, either
    black-on-white or white-on-black.</P>
<P><B>Transfer progress</B> - selects style of file transfer progress bars:
<UL>
    <LI><B>Data files only</B> - shows size & time for data files only.  Directories are not shown,
        except briefly between data files.</LI>
    <LI><B>Hierarchy w/out dir sizes</B> - shows size & time for data files, shows file count for
        directories in the hierarchy.</LI>
    <LI><B>Hierarchy with dir sizes</B> - shows size & time for both data files and directories.
        Requires pre-scanning the directory tree to gather directory sizes.  Directory sizes are the
        total of all included data files plus some crudely guesstimated per-file overhead.</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P><B>VT-100 keyboard</B> - enables VT-100-style keyboard for the <A HREF="shell.html">SHELL</A>
    mode screen.
<UL>
    <LI><B>CTRL and SHIFT</B> - a single click will make them effective just for the next key
        clicked; double-clicking will make them effective for all key clicks until released by a
        third click (lock mode).</LI>
    <LI>The keyboard size can be changed by locking both CTRL and SHIFT modes then clicking the Up
        and Down cursor arrow buttons.  Even so, the keyboard may only be practical on tablet-sized
        screens.</LI>
    <LI>Even if you do not need the VT-100 keypad, you may find having alphas, digits and special
        characters available without having to switch pages convenient.</LI>
    <LI>If you experience double keyboards (the Android keyboard along with the VT-100 keyboard),
        with this setting <I>checked</I>, just dismiss the Android keyboard via the Android's Back
        button.</LI>
    <LI>If you experience no keyboard with this setting <I>unchecked</I>, tap on the SHELL screen
        text to bring focus to the window which should make the Android keyboard visible.</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P><B>Wrap long lines</B> - enables wrapping of long lines from the host onto multiple lines of the
    SHELL screen.  Otherwise, long lines can be viewed by horizontally scrolling the SHELL screen.
    <UL>
        <LI><B><TT>vi</TT></B> works best with the <B>Wrap long lines</B> setting
            <I>checked</I>.</LI>
    </UL>
</P>
<P>Note:  The screen is locked in Portrait orientation while in the SETTINGS screen.</P>
