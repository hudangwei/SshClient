<H3>Known Hosts</H3>
<P>Known Hosts are hostnames that you have acknowledged the fingerprint for.  If it is the first time you have
    connected to a particular host with this app on this device, you will be prompted to confirm the
    fingerprint.  From that point on, the app will remember that you have confirmed the fingerprint and will
    not prompt you again.  If you want the app to forget the remembered fingerprint, use this menu to delete
    it by clicking on it.</P>
