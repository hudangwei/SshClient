<H3>Sessions</H3>
<P>The app can maintain more than one connection to either the same or different remote hosts.  Each
    connection is referred to as a session.  You can create, delete and switch sessions using this menu.</P>
<P>To make a session current, short click on its button.  Its contents will be available on the app's shell,
    file transfer and/or tunnel screens.</P>
<P>To disconnect a session and delete it, long click on its button.</P>
<P>Note:  When a session is not current, the app will continue to receive data from the host and update its
    hidden screen.  If you do not want it to update, you can <A HREF="freezemode.html">freeze</A> it first before
    switching away, then unfreeze it when you return back to it.</P>
<P>The Android's status bar will display the number of connected sessions.  The sessions will remain active
    even if you switch to another app, and the status bar line will remind you that there are active
    sessions.</P>
