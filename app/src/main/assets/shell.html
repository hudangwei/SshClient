<H3>SHELL Screen</H3>
<P>At the top is a single-line text box.  To initiate a connection to a host, type in the
    <TT>username@hostnname</TT> that you want to communicate with.  If it uses a non-standard port number (22),
    use <TT>username@hostname:portnumber</TT> format.  After entering the information, click the keyboard's
    Next or Done button to initiate the connection process.  If the connection requires a passphrase and/or
    password, you will be prompted.  You may also be asked to confirm the fingerprint of the remote host to
    prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.</P>
<P>The app will remember what <TT>username@hostname[:portnumber]</TT>s you have successfully connected to, and
    provide them as auto-completion text next time you want to connect, so you don't have to retype the long
    strings on your small keyboard each time.</P>
<P>The color of the text in the host name entry box is significant:
<UL>
    <LI>BLACK - the app is waiting for the user to enter the information and click Done or Next</LI>
    <LI>BLUE - the app is attempting to connect to the remote host</LI>
    <LI>GREEN - the connection to the remote host is alive and authenticated and ready for use.
        You can use the keyboard to send text to the host and the host's replies will
        appear in the large text area below.</LI>
    <LI>RED - the host has disconnected or failed to connect.  To reconnect, click on the box and
        either just click Done/Next to reconnect to same host or change the info first then click
        Done/Next to connect to a different host.</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>Once connected, by default, the app will open a shell channel and you can communicate with the host shell
    using the keyboard.  If you want to do file transfers or tunnels instead, you can switch to the file
    transfer or tunnels screen from the menu at this point and just leave the shell open.  Or if you prefer to
    have the app not open a shell at all, select file transfer or tunnels from the menu BEFORE connecting and
    the app will switch to that mode as soon as the connection completes without starting shell mode.  You can
    always go back to shell mode later by selecting <TT>shell</TT> from the menu.  Shell mode can also be
    terminated by typing an <TT>exit</TT> or similar command to the host so it will close its shell.  You can
    then switch to the file transfer or tunnels mode screen from the menu.</P>
<P>Note:  If you are having difficulty getting the soft keyboard to appear for sending text to the host,
    try clicking on the Android's menu button then selecting <TT>shell</TT> (again if necessary).</P>
