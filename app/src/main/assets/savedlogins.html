<H3>Saved Logins</H3>
<P>Saved Logins are the <TT>username@hostname[:portnumber]</TT> entries that have successfully connected and
    the corresponding saved password (if you checked the 'Save password' checkbox on the password entry
    dialog).  They also hold the name of the keypair tried, if any.  They are displayed as auto-completion
    suggestions when you make an entry in the <TT>user@host[:port]</TT> box of the SHELL screen.</P>
<P>If you no longer want one of the entries, use this menu to delete the one you don't want.  The menu displays
    the saved <TT>username@hostname[:portnumber]</TT> for each entry, and the name of the associated keypair
    if any, and a 'pw' tag if the password for the entry is saved.</P>
<P>If you want to change or delete a keypair association or a saved password, the only way to do that is to
    delete the whole saved login entry for that login.  Then when you log back in, the entry will be
    re-created.</P>
