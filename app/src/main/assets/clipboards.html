<H3>Clipboards</H3>
<P>Several functions of the app access a clipboard.  In general, there are two clipboards these functions have
    access to.  The <B>internal clipboard</B>'s contents are only available to the app and can be used to
    transfer text information from one screen within the app to another.  No other app can access the internal
    clipboard.  The <B>external clipboard</B>'s contents are available to any app on the device, so you can use
    it to, for example, transfer text between a connected host and an email message displayed in the web
    browser.</P>
<P>The app will only access text-oriented clipboard data.  It will not properly handle other data such as in
    image, video and sound files.</P>
<P>The extended menu contains a <TT>clipboard &lt;-&gt; file</TT> button.  Clicking it brings up another menu
    with these buttons:
<UL>
    <LI><B>Internal clipboard -&gt; File</B> - writes the internal clipboard to a file in the current
        directory opened in the file transfer screen</LI>
    <LI><B>External clipboard -&gt; File</B> - writes the external clipboard to a file in the current
        directory opened in the file transfer screen</LI>
    <LI><B>File -&gt; Internal clipboard</B> - reads the one-and-only selected file to the internal
        clipboard</LI>
    <LI><B>File -&gt; External clipboard</B> - reads the one-and-only selected file to the external
        clipboard</LI>
</UL>
